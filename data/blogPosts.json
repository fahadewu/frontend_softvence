      "content": "<p>Prototyping is a crucial step in the design process, allowing designers to test ideas and gather feedback before final development. The two main types of prototyping are low-fidelity and high-fidelity, each serving different purposes in the design workflow.</p><h4>What is Low-Fidelity Prototyping?</h4><p>Low-fidelity prototypes are simple, often paper-based sketches or wireframes that focus on basic layout and functionality. They're quick to create and easy to modify, making them perfect for early-stage ideation and testing basic user flows.</p><h4>What is High-Fidelity Prototyping?</h4><p>High-fidelity prototypes are detailed, interactive representations that closely resemble the final product. They include realistic design elements, animations, and interactions, providing a more accurate user experience for testing.</p><h4>When to Use Each Type</h4><p>Use low-fidelity prototypes for initial concept testing and rapid iteration. Switch to high-fidelity prototypes when you need to test specific interactions, validate visual design, or present to stakeholders.</p>",
